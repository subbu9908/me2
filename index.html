      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Abhirekha Thimmasani</strong>, a passionate software professional with a background in backend development. I previously worked as a <strong>Backend Engineer at Accenture</strong>, where I developed and maintained APIs, optimized database queries, and worked on scalable microservices. I enjoy solving technical challenges and learning about clean architecture and efficient design practices. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing advanced studies in <strong>Software Architecture and Design</strong> to strengthen my skills in building large-scale systems that are both maintainable and high-performing.</p>

      <h2>What I Hope to Learn from This Course</h2>
      <p>Through this Software Architecture and Design course, I hope to deepen my understanding of <strong>system design principles</strong>, <strong>architectural patterns</strong>, and <strong>scalability strategies</strong>. I want to learn how to make better design decisions, structure large applications efficiently, and apply real-world design patterns in complex systems. This course will help me bridge the gap between writing code and architecting full software solutions.</p>
